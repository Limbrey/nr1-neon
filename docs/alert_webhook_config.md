# Steps to create an alert webhook notification channel

In order to setup a webhook notification key, you will need to do the following steps:

## 1. Generate an Insights insert token

Insights insert tokens can be generated from the _Manage data_ option in your New Relic Insights account (e.g. https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/{your-account-id}/manage/summary

> Appears on the left hand navigation panel on the Insights landing page.

> Select the _Add data_ option from the top navigation menu.

> We will want to create a new _Insert Key_ click the "+" sign to enter the create dialog.

> You just need to enter a note to configure the key, I recommend Neon_Webhook (that will be the name of the Insights event table created)

> Once your key is created keep it handy, you will need it to configure the Webhook.

## 2. Create a Webhook notification channel

> Select the "Webhook" channel type

> Set the "Channel name" as SLOR_ALERTS

> The "Base Url" should be the Insights collector events Url - be sure to specify your Account ID
> `https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/{your account id}/events`

> You will need to add a custom header and specify the X-Insert-Key you generated in step 1 above

![Screenshot #23](../catalog/screenshots/nr1-slo-r-23.png)

> Add a Custom Payload

> Replace the default payload with the one below ...

```

> You should have defined a notification channel that looks like the following

## 3. Create an Alert and add the SLOR_ALERT notification Webhook

Now you have to add the SLOR_ALERTS notification channel to any Alerts you wish to use to make SLO calculations.

> To set a notification channel just select the "Notification channel" tab in an Alert Policy and click "Add notification channels". Select the SLOR_ALERTS Webhook channel you created and associate it with the Alert.

> Note: An Alert has to have fired to be visible to the SLO/R configurstion.
